This project consisted of 3 parts
-Crafting User Experience.
-Establishing variables/Prompts and Confirm statements.
-Defining Conditional statements to call array parameters.

After working through the User Experience and crafting password criteria, I defined variables and used them within the function.
The function contains prompts and confirm statements to establish user criteria. Once the user selects their conditions, the conditional statements work through parameters to define the user's unique password. The password generator works and satisfies all acceptance criteria to best suit the User's need. 

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
